The Multiple Axes Chart provides the option to setup a chart with
minimum of 5 axis as you have measures in the assigned data source,
meaning you could create a chart with an axis for each measure. The
below Figure represents the Multiple Axes Chart with 1 dimension -
Product with 3 Measures - Discount Amount, Order Amount and Order
Quantity. There are 3 Value Axis being shown in the Figure below.

<img alt="Multiple Axes Chart" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/ma1.png')} />

How to use the Multiple Axes Chart in Power BI?
-----------------------------------------------

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Multiple
Axes Chart in Power BI Platform. For our example we will assume that we
are going to use a data source with a dimension Product and measures
Discount Amount, Order Amount and Order Quantity.

1.  Create a new project in Power BI Platform.
2.  Click Get Data Source and select the Excel File with the data source
    similar to the description outlined previously.
3.  Add a Multiple Axes Chart from the Visualization Section to your
    Power BI project.
4.  Assign the data source to the Multiple Axes Chart. For our example,
    assign the Dimension - Product to the property Axis and assign the
    Measures - Discount Amount, Order Amount and Order Quantity to the
    property Value Axis 1 in the Category Fields (see Figure below).

<img alt="Visualization Settings" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/ma2.png')} />

In the above example, you can also assign the Measures and Dimensions to
the Power BI Project by clicking the respective check boxes against the
Dimension and Measures in the Fields Section (see Figure above).

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Value Axis
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Measures can be assigned to any one of the 5 Value Axis and the
  Chart gets plotted based on the assigned Value Axis.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

5.  Navigate to the property Tooltips in the Category Fields. Here the
    Measures and Dimensions can be dragged into this property so that
    you will be able to view the Measures and Dimensions as a Tooltip
    (see Figure below).

<img alt="Visualization Settings" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/ma3.png')} />

In the above example, the Measure Discount Amount has been used as
Tooltip (see Figure above).

6.  Now navigate to the Category Format in the Visualization Section.
    The Category Format for the Multiple Axes Chart has the following
    areas:
    1.  License
    2.  General
    3.  Global Fonts
    4.  X Axis
    5.  Y Axis Configuration
    6.  Series Type
    7.  Data Colors
    8.  Data Labels
    9.  Plot Area
    10. Analytics
    11. Legend
    12. Tooltip
    13. Miscellaneous
    14. Data Measures
    15. Utility Menu

The following sections will highlight the individual configuration of
the properties for the Multiple Axes Chart.

### License

The License Area will display the License details of the PBX Component
(see Figure below).

<img alt="License" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/ma4.png')} />
 

### General

1.  In the General Area, set the property Chart Orientation to the
    option Vertical. The other option is Horizontal (see Figure below).

<img alt="General" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/ma5.png')} />

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the Multiple
Axes Chart having vertical column bars.

2.  The property Align Threshold can be enabled in case when all the
    Value Axis needs to be aligned to start from 0. For our example, we
    use a Data Source which is similar to the Figure as shown below.

<img alt="Data Source" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/ma6.png')} />

For our example, the Measures Order Amount and Order Quantity has been
assigned to the Value Axis 1 and the Measure Discount Amount has been
assigned to the Value Axis 2. Now based on the settings, the Multiple
Axes Chart appears as shown in the below Figure.

<img alt="Measures assigned in Value Axis 1 and Value Axis
2" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/mt1.png')} />

Now navigate to the Format Category. In the Area General, enable the
property Align Threshold (see Figure below).

<img alt="Measures assigned in Value Axis 1 and Value Axis
2" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/mt2.png')} />

From the above Figure, it is observed that the Value Axis 1 and Value
Axis 2 has been aligned to start from 0.

### Global Fonts

3.  A Report can be also shown as a Tooltip when clicking the chart
    area. For our example, we have the Multiple Axes Chart assigned in
    Page 1. Now assign a Pie chart in Page 2 with the same set of data
    which we used for the Multiple Axes Chart. The Pie Chart will be
    similar to the Figure shown below:

    <img alt="Pie Chart in Page 2" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/ma66.png')} />

4.  Now navigate to the Page 2 Format Category (see Figure below). In
    the Area Page Information, activate the property Tooltip as shown in

The Pan and Zoom property will be used to activate the zooming option
for the X-Axis or Y-Axis. You can use the mouse pointer and drag out a
rectangle in the chart itself, and the selected area will be used for
zooming. Unlike pinch zooming, you can\'t pan the zoomed area, but has
to zoom out on a new area. On touch devices, you can zoom by pinching in
the chart area. On these devices, you may also move the zoomed area by
panning with one finger across the chart.

2.  The below properties can be set for the Pan and Zoom option in both
    Desktop and Mobile Device (see Figure above).

-   Panning Key - Sets the Panning Key for the Desktop . The options are
    Shift and Ctrl.
-   Mouse Zoom Type - Sets the Mouse Zoom Type for the Desktop. The

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the Multiple
Axes Chart showing the configured Footer settings as shown below.

> <img alt="Footer in Multiple Axes Chart" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/ma72.png')} />

4.  Activate the property Enable Hierarchy as shown in the below Figure.

    <img alt="Enable Hierarchy" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/ma73.png')} />

### Data Measures

1.  Navigate to the Area Data Measures in the category Format (see
    Figure below). For our example, there are three Measures - Discount
    Amount, Order Amount and Order Quantity and one dimension - Product.
    By default, all the Measures will be enabled. When any one Measure
    is disabled, the Multiple Axes Chart will get displayed without the
    display of the disabled Measure. For our example, the measure
    Discount Amount has been disabled.

    <img alt="Data Measures" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/ma74.png')} />

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the Multiple
Axes Chart without the display of the Measure Discount Amount (see
Figure below).

> <img alt="Multiple Axes Chart without the display of the Measure-Discount
> Amount" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/multipleaxes/ma75.png')} />

### Utility Menu

The function of all the Utility options are listed below:

-   Enable JPEG - This property sets the download option of the jpeg
    image for the chart. This option can be viewed only in the web
    version of the Power BI.

-   Enable PDF - This property sets the download option of the pdf file
    for the chart. This option can be viewed only in the web version of
    the Power BI.

-   Lasso - The Lasso option will select those elements in the chart
    that are inside the selected area. For our example, we will use a
    Multiple Axes Chart with three measures -- Discount Amount, Order
    Amount and Order Quantity -- and several dimension members (see
    Figure below). After you have activated the Lasso option from the
    chart menu, you can then select the elements in the chart (see
    Figure below)-- in our example the measures for dimension members
    Chair and TV Stand have been selected.

After you selected the items, the selected items will be visible leaving
the unselected items as a smoky layer (see Figure below).

    in the chart that are outside the selected area. For our example, we
    will use a Multiple Axes Chart with three measures -- Discount
    Amount, Order Amount and Order Quantity -- and several dimension
    members (see Figure below). After you have activated the Reverse
    Lasso option from the chart menu, you can then select the element in
    the chart (see Figure below)-- in our example the measures for
    dimension member Chair have been selected.
