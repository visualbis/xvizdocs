Horizon charts are small multiple area charts visualization. They can be
quite useful for visualizing changes in distributions over time or
space. It is small-multiple area charts that allow greater precision for
a given vertical space by using colored bands. These charts can also be
used with diverging color scales to differentiate positive and negative
values.

Horizon charts are partially overlapping line plots that create the
impression of a mountain range (see Figure below).

How to use the Horizon Chart in Power BI?
-----------------------------------------

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Horizon
Chart in Power BI Platform. For our example we will assume that we are
going to use a data source with two dimensions - Product and Date and
measures Discount Amount, Order Amount and Order Quantity.

1.  Create a new project in Power BI Platform.
2.  Click Get Data Source and select the Excel File with the data source
    similar to the description outlined previously.
3.  Add a Horizon Chart from the Visualization Section to your Power BI
    project.
4.  Assign the data source to the Horizon Chart. For our example, assign
    the Dimension Product to the property Category and assign the
    Dimension Date to the property Time Period. Assign the Measure Order
    Quantity to the property Value (see Figure below).

In the above example, you can also assign the Measures and Dimensions to
the Power BI Project by clicking the respective check boxes against the
Dimension and Measures in the Fields Section (see Figure above).

5.  Now navigate to the Category Format in the Visualization Section.
    The Category Format for the Horizon Chart has the following areas:
    1.  License
    2.  General
    3.  Base Value
    4.  Layers
    5.  Color Scheme
    6.  Legend
    7.  Number Formatting
    8.  Global Fonts

The following sections will highlight the individual configuration of
the properties for the Horizon Chart.

### License

The License Area will display the License details of the PBX Component
(see Figure below).

<img alt="License" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/horizon/hr3.png')} /> 

### General

1.  For our example, set the property Chart Margin to the value 100 in
    the Area General (see Figure below).

<img alt="General" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/horizon/hr4.png')} />

2.  Set the property Tick Interval to the value 1.
3.  Set the property X Position to the value 8.
4.  Set the property Y Position to the value 0.
5.  Set the property Width to the value 1270.
6.  Set the property Height to the value 719.
7.  Set the property Alt Text to the description of your choice.
8.  Based on the above set of configurations, you will be able to view
    the Horizon Chart as shown below.

<img alt="Horizon Chart with General
configuration" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/horizon/hr5.png')} />

From the above Figure, you can observe that the Measures based on the
Product and Time Stamp will be viewed as small-multiple area charts. As
you hover the mouse over those charts, you will be able to view the
distributed values of the Measures in that range.

### Base value

Base Value are the value from which the Positive or Negative changes are
plotted on the Chart. Now navigate to the Area Base Value. Set the
property Base Value to the value 100 (see Figure below).

<img alt="Base Value" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/horizon/hr6.png')} />

Based on the above Base Value configuration, you will be able to view
the Horizon Chart with a Layer representing the Base Value (see Figure
below).

<img alt="Horizon Chart with Base Value
configuration" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/horizon/hr7.png')} />

### Layers

The Horizon Charts will be having a maximum of 5 layers. Now navigate to
the Area Layers. For our example, set the property Layers to the value 5
(see Figure below).

<img alt="Base Value" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/horizon/hr8.png')} />

Based on the above Layers configuration, you will be able to view the
Horizon Chart with 5 Layers (see Figure below).

<img alt="Horizon Chart with Layers
configuration" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/horizon/hr9.png')} />

### Color Scheme

The Horizon Charts will be having a maximum of 9 Color Schemes. Now
navigate to the Area Color Scheme. For our example, set the property
Scheme to the option Spectral (see Figure below). The other options are
Red-Blue, Red-Grey, Purple-Orange, Red-Yellow-Blue, Red-Yellow-Green,
Pink-Red-Green, Pink-Yellow-Green and Brown-Blue-Green.

<img alt="Color Scheme" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/horizon/hr10.png')} />

Based on the above Color Scheme configuration, you will be able to view
the Horizon Chart configured with Spectral Color Scheme (see Figure
below).

Scheme" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/horizon/hr11.png')} />

### Legend

1.  Navigate to the Area Legend in the category Format. You have the
    option to enable the Legend and configure the settings for the
    Legend (see Figure below).

    <img alt="Enable Legend" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/horizon/hr12.png')} />

For our example, configure the below listed Legend properties for the
Horizon Chart as shown in the Figure above.

-   Vertical Alignment - Set the Vertical Alignment as Top for the
    Legend. The other options are Bottom and Middle.
-   Horizontal Alignment - Set the Horizontal Alignment as Left for the
    Legend. The other options are Center and Right.
-   Title - Activate the property Title.
-   Legend Name - Set the property Legend Name to the Text Legend.
-   Font Color - Set the property Font Color to the color Red.
-   Title Text Size - Set the property Title Text Size to the value 12.

Based on the above set of configuration, you will be able to view the
Horizon Chart being configured with the Legend properties (see Figure
below).

### Number Formatting

1.  Navigate to the Area Number Formatting in the category Format. You
    have the option to configure the settings for the Number Formatting
    (see Figure below).

    <img alt="Number Formatting" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/horizon/hr14.png')} />

2.  Set the property Value decimal places to the value 2.

3.  Set the property Thousand Separator to \",\".

4.  Set the property Decimal Separator to \".\".

5.  Set the property Display Units to the option Default. The other
    options are Thousand, Million, Billion and Trillion.

6.  Set the property Prefix to \"p\".

7.  Set the property Suffix to \"s\".

Based on the above set of configuration, you will be able to view the
Horizon Chart being configured with the Number Formatting properties
(see Figure below).

> Chart" src={useBaseUrl('/images/visuals/horizon/hr15.png')} />

### Global Fonts

1.  Navigate to the Area Global Fonts in the category Format. You have
    the option to configure the settings for the Global Fonts (see
    Figure below).
