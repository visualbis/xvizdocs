### AND or OR Logical Functions in Conditional Formatting

In case when there are more than one Condition, then you will be able to
view the option for AND or OR Logical Function as shown in the below
Figure.

> <img alt="AND or OR Logical Function" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cf19.png')} />

It is to be noted that the multiple conditions can be created using the
\"+\" button as shown in the Figure above. For our example, the below
Figure shows the configuration for Condition 1.

> <img alt="Condition 1" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cf20.png')} />

The below Figure shows the configuration for Condition 2.

> <img alt="Condition 2" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cf21.png')} />

OR Function:

When any one condtion set for the Rule gets satisfied, then the
conditional formatting for the OR Function gets applied. As a result of
the OR Function, you will be able to view the Multiple Axes Chart as
shown below.

> <img alt="Conditional Formatting for OR
> Function" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cf22.png')} />

AND Function:

When all condtions get satisfied, then the conditional formatting for
the AND Function gets applied.As a result of the AND Function, you will
be able to view the Multiple Axes Chart as shown below.

> <img alt="Conditional Formatting for AND
> Function" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cf23.png')} />

Custom API
----------

Using Custom API Tab, you will be able to create a customized Template
based on the generated JSON Script. Set the property Choose Template to
the option Template 1 (see Figure below).

> <img alt="Template 1" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/ca1.png')} />

Now copy the JSON script from the Editor (see Figure below).

> <img alt="JSON Script from Template 1" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/ca2.png')} />

Now select the option Custom from the property Choose Template. Paste
the copied JSON script into the Editor screen of the Custom option. For
our example the Title has been changed as \"Multiple Axes Chart\" in the
JSON Script (see Figure below).

> <img alt="JSON Script in Custom option" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/ca3.png')} />

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the Multiple
Axes Chart with the Title being changed as Multiple Axes Chart (see
Figure below).

> <img alt="Multiple Axes Chart with configured Custom
> API" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/ca4.png')} />

Custom CSS
----------

Using Custom CSS, you will be able to customize the CSS style for the
chart. For our example, the background color code has been changed for
the chart (see Figure below).

> <img alt="Chart Background Color Change in
> CSS" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cc1.png')} />

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the Multiple
Axes Chart with the Background Color being changed to Grey Color (see
Figure below).

> <img alt="Multiple Axes Chart with configured
> CSS" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cc2.png')} />

Context Menu
------------

Using Context Menu, you will be able to perform specific actions in the
Chart. You will have the ability to leverage functions, such as auto
size single column, autosize all columns, filtering and setting the
Pivot Mode configuration. Now click the Context Menu icon as shown in
the below Figure.

> <img alt="Context Menu in Chart" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cm1.png')} />

After clicking the Context Menu icon, you will be able to view the Table
as shown in the below Figure.

> <img alt="Table view" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cm2.png')} />

### Pin Column

Using the Pin Column Context Menu, the selected column will be moved the
left first column or the last right column. By clicking the Pin Column
options, you will be allowed to select the Pin Left or Pin Right options
(see Figure below).

> <img alt="Pin Column" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cm3.png')} />

### Autosize This Column

The Context Menu Autosize This Column allows you to size the selected
column based on the width of Column Header Text (see Figure below).

> <img alt="Autosize This Column" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cm4.png')} />

### Autosize All columns

The Context Menu Autosize All Columns allows you to size all the columns
based on the width of Column Header Text (see Figure below).

> <img alt="Autosize All Columns" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cm5.png')} />

### Filter options

You will be able to filter the members using the Logical conditions as
shown below.

> <img alt="Filter option" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cm6.png')} />

You will be also able to filter the members by the respective check box
selection as shown below.

> <img alt="Filter option" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cm7.png')} />

### Pivot Mode

The Pivot Mode option in the Context Menu of the Chart allows you to
swap between the selected dimensions in the columns with the Row Groups
and apply the functions such as avg, count, first, last, max, min and
sum for the measures selected against those dimensions.

> <img alt="Pivot option" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cm8.png')} />

For our example, we have swapped the dimension Product to the Row Groups
and applied the function Count for the measure Discount Amount, function
First for the Order Amount and function Max for the Order Quantity (see
Figure above). Based on the configuration, we would be able to visualize
the Table as shown in the below Figure.

> <img alt="Table showing configured Pivot
> option" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cm9.png')} />

Note: If there are more than one dimension being selected in the Pivot
Mode option, then the Table will be representing a Hierarchical
Structure with first Dimension as Parent and the consequent Dimensions
as child (see Figure below).

> <img alt="Table showing configured Pivot option for more than one
> dimension" src={useBaseUrl('/images/general/cm10.png')} />
